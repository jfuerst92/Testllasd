### Comprehensive Evaluation Report on the Use of Llama 2 for Military Research Applications

#### Introduction

This report assesses the suitability of the Llama 2 model, under its license agreement and Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) provided by Meta, for deployment in military research settings. It aims to clarify the alignment of Llama 2's licensing and usage policies with the operational, security, and compliance standards necessary for military applications.

#### License Agreement Overview

The Llama 2 license offers a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, and royalty-free limited license for use, reproduction, distribution, creation of derivative works, and modification of Llama 2 materials. There are no explicit restrictions on military and defense uses; however, compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and the AUP is mandatory.

#### Acceptable Use Policy Analysis

Meta emphasizes safe and fair use, establishing prohibitions to safeguard against legal violations, rights infringements, harmful actions, and deceptive practices. Key restrictions relevant to military applications include:

1. **Prohibition of Illegal and Harmful Activities**: The use of Llama 2 in engaging, promoting, or facilitating illegal activities, violence, terrorism, exploitation, human trafficking, and other criminal behaviors is strictly banned.

2. **Restrictions on Discrimination and Harassment**: Activities that incite harassment, discrimination, or unauthorized professional practice are prohibited, mandating ethical AI use in all applications.

3. **Protection of Third-Party Rights**: The AUP safeguards against actions that infringe on third-party rights, including creating or facilitating malicious code and impairing computer systems' integrity.

4. **Explicit Military and Warfare Restrictions**: Notably, the AUP explicitly bans Llama 2's use in military, warfare, nuclear industries, espionage, and ITAR-subject activities, significantly limiting its applicability in direct military research contexts.

5. **Prevention of Deception and Misleading Uses**: Misleading others through fraud, disinformation, defamation, and impersonation using Llama 2 is prohibited, emphasizing transparency in AI-generated outputs.

6. **Disclosure Obligations**: Known dangers associated with AI systems must be disclosed to end users, underscoring the commitment to user safety and informed usage.

#### Implications for Military Research Applications

Given the AUP's stringent prohibitions, especially the explicit restriction on military and warfare applications, the deployment of Llama 2 within military research faces substantial limitations. Direct combat, intelligence operations, and activities under ITAR regulations are categorically prohibited, channeling potential use towards non-combat, support, or logistical functions that comply with ethical and legal standards.

#### Conclusion and Recommendations

The Llama 2 license agreement, complemented by its Acceptable Use Policy, presents significant constraints on the model's employment in military contexts, particularly in operations directly related to combat or intelligence. While non-combat applications may remain viable, entities must ensure strict adherence to the AUP, prioritizing legal, ethical, and safe AI deployment practices.

Military entities interested in Llama 2 must undertake comprehensive legal and ethical evaluations against the license and AUP to ensure full compliance. The engagement of legal and ethical advisors is strongly recommended to navigate the complex landscape of AI application in military settings responsibly, focusing on the development and use of AI technologies that respect stringent operational, ethical, and legal standards.


### Evaluation Report on the Use of the Gemma Model for Military Research Applications

#### Introduction

This report assesses the suitability of the Gemma model, under its Terms of Use (ToU) and Prohibited Use Policy, for deployment in military research contexts as specified by the requirements provided. It aims to clarify the alignment of the Gemma model's licensing and usage policies with the operational, security, and ethical standards necessary for military applications.

#### 1. Application Nature and Scope

The Gemma model's Terms of Use do not explicitly prevent the application of the model towards military and defense sectors. However, consideration must be given to sections of the ToU and Prohibited Use Policy that may indirectly pertain to specific military applications. The emphasis is on ensuring that the use of Gemma does not contravene any legal, ethical, or operational guidelines inherent to military engagements.

#### 2. Flexibility in Task Application

The ToU and Prohibited Use Policy of Gemma allow for a broad range of applications, not precluding any specific tasks provided they adhere to the outlined restrictions against generating harmful content or engaging in illegal activities. This flexibility implies that, while all available tasks are fair game, the end-use must rigorously ensure compliance with the guidelines, especially in contexts with potential for dual-use applications that could be interpreted as encouraging or facilitating prohibited activities.

#### 3. Usage Volume and Deployment Environment

The licensing terms facilitate the download and deployment of Gemma on internal hardware, compatible with environments requiring high levels of data privacy and operational security, such as air-gapped systems. The ToU does not impose limitations on the volume of use, accommodating the variable usage patterns expected in military research. This aspect is crucial for ensuring the model's adaptability to the fluctuating demands of defense-related tasks.

#### 4. Data Privacy, Model Tunability, and System Integration

Gemma's licensing framework supports the use of the model in settings where data privacy is paramount, with no explicit restrictions that would hinder operation in completely air-gapped environments. The provisions for model modification, retraining, and integration with designed systems under the ToU suggest that Gemma can be adapted to meet specific research requirements and operational constraints of military applications. However, users must navigate the policy stipulations with caution, particularly ensuring that any modifications or integrations do not facilitate prohibited uses.

#### 5. Preference for Open Source Models

While Gemma's ToU offers considerable freedom in terms of use, reproduction, modification, and distribution, the overarching control and restrictions laid out in the Prohibited Use Policy necessitate careful consideration. The preference for open-source models is acknowledged; however, the Gemma model, governed by its specific ToU, mandates adherence to a structured set of conditions that may not align with the unrestricted nature typically associated with open-source licensing. It is essential for entities seeking to deploy Gemma in military contexts to evaluate these conditions in light of their operational requirements and ethical guidelines.

#### Conclusion

In summary, the Gemma model presents a viable option for military research applications, provided that its use strictly adheres to the conditions and restrictions outlined in the Terms of Use and Prohibited Use Policy. The flexibility in task application, coupled with the model's compatibility with air-gapped environments and tunability, aligns with the operational and security needs of military research. However, the necessity for diligent oversight to ensure compliance with the policy's ethical and legal constraints cannot be overstated. Entities considering Gemma for military applications must undertake thorough legal and ethical evaluations to ensure that their intended use cases do not conflict with the stipulated terms, prioritizing transparency, accountability, and the safeguarding of individual and collective rights.
